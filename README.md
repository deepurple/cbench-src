# cbench-src
A compressed package containing all the source code needed for compiling cbench

The cbench installation instruction can be found at http://www.sdnlab.com/2334.html

This repository contains source code of oflops, openflow and libconfig, so you can directly start installation from the 9th line of the instruction

Good luck
